# Three.js Project: Spinning Cube with Orbiting Spheres

Welcome to the Three.js project, where we explore creating a 3D animation featuring a spinning cube with orbiting spheres, all rendered in the browser using WebGL without any plugins. This project demonstrates the basic setup and use of Three.js, along with implementing mouse controls for user interaction.

## Description

This project showcases a 3D scene using Three.js, where a cube spins slowly in the center, and four small spheres orbit it at a faster pace on their own orbital paths. This interactive animation provides a simple introduction to 3D graphics using Three.js, offering users the ability to manipulate the scene using mouse controls.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: JavaScript library for 3D graphics
- **JavaScript**: Core scripting language
- **HTML5**: Structure for the webpage
- **CSS3**: Styling for the webpage

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/threejs-project.git
cd threejs-project
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Ensure you have npm or yarn installed. Then, run the command below to install Three.js:

```bash
npm install
```

   Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add three
```

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the animation.
2. Use your mouse to click and drag, allowing you to spin the cube and spheres in any direction.
3. Use `npm start` in terminal to load live server

## Features

- Spinning cube and orbiting spheres rendered in real-time using Three.js
- Mouse controls to interact with the 3D scene
- Responsive design that adjusts to window resizing
